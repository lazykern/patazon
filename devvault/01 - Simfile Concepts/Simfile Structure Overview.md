# Simfile Structure Overview

Tags: #concept #simfile

A DTX simfile is a plain text file, typically with a `.dtx` extension, that defines a playable song chart. At its core, the file is composed of two primary sections.

---

### 1. Header Section

The header is located at the top of the file. Every line in this section begins with a `#` character. Its primary responsibilities are:

*   **Metadata**: Defining song information like [[Header Commands|TITLE, ARTIST, and BPM]].
*   **Resource Definitions**: [[Resource Mapping|Mapping sound files (#WAV) and image files (#BMP)]] to two-character hexadecimal IDs (e.g., `01`, `FF`).
*   **Initial Settings**: Defining global gameplay parameters.

### 2. Body Section

The body contains the musical chart data. It consists of a series of channel commands, where each line defines events for a specific measure.

*   **Structure**: The body is made up of measures, identified by a three-digit number (e.g., `#001`, `#002`).
*   **Content**: Each measure contains [[Channel Data|channel definitions]] that specify when notes should be played, which sounds to trigger, and which background videos/images to display.

### Example

Here is a minimal DTX file showing the two sections:

```dtx
; --- HEADER SECTION ---
#TITLE: Minimal Example
#ARTIST: Gemini
#BPM: 120
#WAV01: kick.wav
#WAV02: snare.wav

; --- BODY SECTION ---
#00112: 02000200
#00113: 01000100
```

This separation allows an engine to first parse all metadata and resources before processing the note chart itself, which is covered in [[Simfile Parsing Strategy]].
