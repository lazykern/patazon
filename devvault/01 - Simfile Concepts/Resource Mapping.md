# Resource Mapping

Tags: #concept #simfile #resources

Resource mapping is the process by which a DTX simfile associates short, two-character hexadecimal IDs with external asset files, such as audio samples and images. This is a critical step in the [[Simfile Parsing Strategy|parsing process]].

## Audio Resources (`#WAV`)

The `#WAVxx` command maps a hex ID (`xx`) to a sound file. The engine must load these files into memory to be triggered by [[Channel Data]].

*   **Syntax**: `#WAVxx: <filename.wav>`
*   **Example**: `#WAV01: kick.wav`

Here, the ID `01` is now an alias for `kick.wav`. When channel `11` (Hi-Hat) contains a `01`, the engine knows to play `kick.wav`.

## Image Resources (`#BMP`)

The `#BMPxx` command works identically, but for image files used in background animations ([[BGA and BGI Channels|BGA/BGI]]).

*   **Syntax**: `#BMPxx: <filename.bmp>`
*   **Example**: `#BMP01: background_intro.bmp`

The guide also specifies `#BMPTEXxx`, which is flagged to be loaded as a renderable texture rather than just a simple bitmap.

## Video Resources (`#AVI`)

Similar to other resources, `#AVIxx` maps an ID to a video file. The command `#VIDEOxx` is a common alias.

*   **Syntax**: `#AVIxx: <filename.avi>`
*   **Example**: `#AVI01: intro_movie.avi`

## BPM Change Resources (`#BPM`)

Instead of just changing the BPM directly, the DTX format allows for defining a map of target BPMs. This is the standard way to handle mid-song tempo changes. The ID is then referenced later in the body by channel `08`.

*   **Syntax**: `#BPMxx: <BPM value>`
*   **Example**: `#BPM01: 220.5`

### Example from a file

The following is a snippet from a real `.dtx` file showing how various resources are mapped. Note that `#BMPxx` is not used in this particular file, but its syntax is identical to `#WAVxx`.

```dtx
; Audio Resources
#WAV0C: GAV-CHIHAT1.ogg
#WAV0K: GAV-SNARE2.ogg
#WAV0U: GAV-KICK2.ogg

; Video Resources
#AVI01: Toe - Goodbye.mp4

; BPM Resources
#BPM01: 136.6742
#BPM02: 137.2997
```

## The Resource Table

A parser should build a data structureâ€”often a dictionary or hash mapâ€”to store these mappings. This "resource table" allows for quick lookups during the body parsing phase.

**Example Table:**

| ID  | Type   | Value / File Path |
| --- | ------ | ----------------- |
| `01`| `WAV`  | `kick.wav`        |
| `02`| `WAV`  | `snare.wav`       |
| `A0`| `BMP`  | `intro_image.bmp` |
| `A1`| `AVI`  | `cutscene.avi`    |
| `B1`| `BPM`  | `220.5`           |


This table is essential for translating the abstract IDs in the channel data into concrete assets to be used by the [[ðŸ”Š Audio System MOC|audio]] and rendering engines.

An example based on the snippet above would look like this:

| ID | Type | Value / File Path |
|---|---|---|
| `0C`| `WAV` | `GAV-CHIHAT1.ogg` |
| `0K`| `WAV` | `GAV-SNARE2.ogg` |
| `0U`| `WAV` | `GAV-KICK2.ogg` |
| `01`| `AVI` | `Toe - Goodbye.mp4` |
| `B1`| `BPM` | `136.6742` |
| `B2`| `BPM` | `137.2997` |

*(Note: The original file used IDs `01` and `02` for its BPMs, but we've used `B1` and `B2` here for clarity to show how different resource types have their own ID mappings.)*
