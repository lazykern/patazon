# Groove Gauge

The Groove Gauge is the player's "life bar" or "health meter" during gameplay. It provides immediate feedback on performance and serves as the primary condition for clearing or failing a song.

## How It Works

The gauge is a numerical value, typically from 0% to 100%. Its behavior is tied directly to the [[Judgment System]].

*   **Increase**: Hitting notes with good accuracy (`Perfect`, `Great`) increases the gauge. The amount of increase can be weighted, with `Perfect`s rewarding more than `Great`s.
*   **Decrease**: Missing a note or hitting it with poor accuracy (`Poor`, `Miss`) decreases the gauge.
*   **Clear Condition**: To "clear" a song, the player must typically finish with the gauge above a certain threshold (e.g., 80%).
*   **Fail Condition**: If the gauge drops to 0% at any point, the player fails the song immediately ("Stage Failed").

## Configurability and Gameplay Modes

A key feature of a robust engine, as highlighted in the developer guides, is making the gauge's behavior highly configurable. This allows for different difficulty settings and gameplay modes.

*   **Damage Level**: The amount of gauge lost on a `Poor` or `Miss` can be adjusted. A "Hard" or "Expert" setting would feature a much more punishing damage level.
*   **Sudden Death**: A special mode where the gauge starts at 100% and any `Poor` or `Miss` results in an instant Stage Failed.
*   **Risky / Hazard**: A variation of Sudden Death where the player is allowed a small number of mistakes (e.g., 1-10) before failing.
*   **Training / Practice Mode**: A setting can be added to prevent the gauge from decreasing, allowing players to practice a song without fear of failing.

The Groove Gauge is a fundamental system for adding stakes and measuring success in a rhythm game.
