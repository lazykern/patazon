# üè† The DTXMania Developer's Notebook

Tags: #moc

Welcome to the DTXMania Developer's Notebook. This vault is a living document designed to deconstruct the architecture and mechanics of a DTX-compatible rhythm game engine.

Its purpose is to serve as a highly-interconnected "Second Brain" for developers, making it easy to explore concepts, understand dependencies, and build your own engine.

## Core Systems (Maps of Content)

These are the three pillars of the engine. Each link below leads to a "Map of Content" (MOC) that serves as a high-level index for that topic.

*   **[[üéµ Simfile Parsing MOC]]**: Everything you need to know about reading `.dtx` files, from header commands to channel data.
*   **[[üéÆ Gameplay Engine MOC]]**: The core logic of the game, including the state machine, judgment system, scoring, and more.
*   **[[üîä Audio System MOC]]**: The intricate details of the audio engine, from low-latency playback to critical drumming mechanics like polyphony and choking.

## How to Use This Vault

This vault is designed to be explored through its connections.

1.  **Start with a MOC**: Click one of the links above to get an overview of a system.
2.  **Dive into Atomic Notes**: From the MOC, navigate to the specific, "atomic" concept you're interested in.
3.  **Follow the Links**: Use the `[[WikiLinks]]` within each note to discover related concepts and dependencies.
4.  **Use the Graph View**: Open the graph view (Ctrl+G) to visualize the connections between all notes. Use the color-coding for tags (`#moc`, `#concept`, `#mechanic`) to quickly identify different types of information.
